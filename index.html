      <h2>Week #1 -> Short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        This activity of presenting ourselves reminds me of my early days in
        elementary school. the teacher would always ask us to give some
        information about ourselves in some sort of activity. Sometimes, we
        would get handed out questionnaires with little boxes that needed to be
        filled out, make drawings our houses, family, friends, or of us. But, my
        favorite one was making acronyms with my name. I would write down my
        name vertically and write a word that is representative of me at each
        letter. I have done these dozens of times, but I wanted to do it again
        for this bio, but with a twist. So, I have asked ChatGPT to create the
        acronym with words that he thinks represent me, both negative and
        positive, based on our previous conversations. Let's see what came out
        and if it is True:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>A</b>dventurous: I am adventurous, I love hiking, biking and
          travel, always down for an adventure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R</b>esourceful: I am resourceful as well, I usually don't like
          asking for help unless I am really stuck, I think it is really
          beneficial to find what you need to know yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>uturing: I think this is also true, but not as much as the
          last two. I am not the most nuturing friend, this is something I could
          work on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A</b>nalytical: I think this is also accurate. I really like
          analyzing results, looking deep into subjects, and I am good at
          discerning certain things from situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>U</b>nderstanding: Very accurate as well. I think I am very
          understanding and tend to not see things that happen to me as
          personal. I am rarely frustrated when friends cancel on me and also
          understanding in profesional environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>D</b>etermined: Not as much as I would like. There are a lot of
          things I am not willing to sacrifice to accomplish my goals such as
          time off, comfort, alone time and many others. I still work hard but
          not as much as other people.
        </li>
        <li>----</li>
        <li>
          <b>J</b>oyful: That is very much true. I am often being called a
          "golden retriever" since I'm always making jokes and trying to lighten
          the mood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A</b>daptable: Yes, I feel like this is similar to "understanding".
          I can easily adapt to different environment and situations. I will not
          necessarily fit right in everywhere but will always be able to adapt
          myself to get along.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>B</b>enevolent: That is true as well. I really like taking some
          time to help out other people, but I do have my limits as well. I am
          very self-reliant, so I do expect people to be too. I don't mind
          giving some time to help out, but I don't like when people dump their
          responsibilities on me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>L</b>oyal: This is something that is very important to me.
          Respecting engagements and being loyal to your words is something that
          I always do and that I admire in other people. Trust in your friends,
          partners and colleagues is something that is hard to achieve but when
          done right gives you the opportunity accomplish a lot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>E</b>nergetic: Also true. This goes back to my golden retriever
          attitude. I always have energy and always willing to do something.
          But, I feel like I have lost some of my drive and the last 2 years.
          Maybe I'm getting older, or my priorities are changing, I don't
          know...
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R</b>espectful: This is also a priority for me. Respecting yourself
          and others is the key to establishing healthy relationships with
          others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>T</b>rusthworthy: Very similar to loyalty, it is important that my
          act on what I say. I expect the same from others, so I act the way I
          wish other would act with me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All in all, I feel like ChatGPT did a good job(which does not happen
        often). He did forget to put the "b" in "Jalbert" three times even when
        I told him. The answers he gave me are also pretty generic, but it did
        give me a playground to talk about myself.
      </p>
      <h2>Week #3 -> Crowd-sourcing</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to explore "Exhausting a Crowd". I think the concept is very
        interesting. I believe that this is a way to criticise "turking". It is
        very clear that only humans(or a very good AI) would be able to
        accurately describe what is happening in the footage. And even then, the
        footage quality is pretty low and some actions are very hard to see.
        People try to note what is happening, but we quickly see that what we
        see can be very different for me and for other viewers. We each have our
        own perception on what is going on, what we think the people in the
        footage are feeling, doing, going to. I think this shows how biased our
        view on such a simple thing like camera footage is. The things we notice
        and the "data" we create is biased and the problem would be to assume
        that this data is reality and true. Now, imagining that this kind of
        footage could be analyzed by artificial intelligence that can make
        errors and that is trained on data that is biased as well, it is even
        more dangerous to take this as the truth. Knowing this, it would make
        sense to not use the conclusion of the analysis of camera footage to
        make decision, but unfortunately, information like that is used by
        governments and law enforcement. Using tools like this can be useful and
        good if used in the right way. But, we always need to keep in mind that
        the technology we use is always biased and that we need to keep this in
        mind when using it.
