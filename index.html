      <h2>Week #1 -> Short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        This activity of presenting ourselves reminds me of my early days in
        elementary school. the teacher would always ask us to give some
        information about ourselves in some sort of activity. Sometimes, we
        would get handed out questionnaires with little boxes that needed to be
        filled out, make drawings our houses, family, friends, or of us. But, my
        favorite one was making acronyms with my name. I would write down my
        name vertically and write a word that is representative of me at each
        letter. I have done these dozens of times, but I wanted to do it again
        for this bio, but with a twist. So, I have asked ChatGPT to create the
        acronym with words that he thinks represent me, both negative and
        positive, based on our previous conversations. Let's see what came out
        and if it is True:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>A</b>dventurous: I am adventurous, I love hiking, biking and
          travel, always down for an adventure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R</b>esourceful: I am resourceful as well, I usually don't like
          asking for help unless I am really stuck, I think it is really
          beneficial to find what you need to know yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>uturing: I think this is also true, but not as much as the
          last two. I am not the most nuturing friend, this is something I could
          work on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A</b>nalytical: I think this is also accurate. I really like
          analyzing results, looking deep into subjects, and I am good at
          discerning certain things from situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>U</b>nderstanding: Very accurate as well. I think I am very
          understanding and tend to not see things that happen to me as
          personal. I am rarely frustrated when friends cancel on me and also
          understanding in profesional environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>D</b>etermined: Not as much as I would like. There are a lot of
          things I am not willing to sacrifice to accomplish my goals such as
          time off, comfort, alone time and many others. I still work hard but
          not as much as other people.
        </li>
        <li>----</li>
        <li>
          <b>J</b>oyful: That is very much true. I am often being called a
          "golden retriever" since I'm always making jokes and trying to lighten
          the mood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A</b>daptable: Yes, I feel like this is similar to "understanding".
          I can easily adapt to different environment and situations. I will not
          necessarily fit right in everywhere but will always be able to adapt
          myself to get along.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>B</b>enevolent: That is true as well. I really like taking some
          time to help out other people, but I do have my limits as well. I am
          very self-reliant, so I do expect people to be too. I don't mind
          giving some time to help out, but I don't like when people dump their
          responsibilities on me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>L</b>oyal: This is something that is very important to me.
          Respecting engagements and being loyal to your words is something that
          I always do and that I admire in other people. Trust in your friends,
          partners and colleagues is something that is hard to achieve but when
          done right gives you the opportunity accomplish a lot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>E</b>nergetic: Also true. This goes back to my golden retriever
          attitude. I always have energy and always willing to do something.
          But, I feel like I have lost some of my drive and the last 2 years.
          Maybe I'm getting older, or my priorities are changing, I don't
          know...
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R</b>espectful: This is also a priority for me. Respecting yourself
          and others is the key to establishing healthy relationships with
          others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>T</b>rusthworthy: Very similar to loyalty, it is important that my
          act on what I say. I expect the same from others, so I act the way I
          wish other would act with me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All in all, I feel like ChatGPT did a good job(which does not happen
        often). He did forget to put the "b" in "Jalbert" three times even when
        I told him. The answers he gave me are also pretty generic, but it did give
        me a playground to talk about myself.
